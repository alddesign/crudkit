## About
CRUDKit lets you create UI webpages for existing databases within minutes.

**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete. Often, nothing more than these four basic operations are needed by user. CRUDKits helps to provide these in a fashionable manner. Great results can be achived even without a single line of code, as CRUDKit can automatically generate webpages. Beyond that its highly configurable and extendable. 

CRUDKit runs on [PHP](https://php.net/) and uses the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework as its foundation. [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/) is used to draw the frontend.
